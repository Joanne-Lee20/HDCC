    <h2>Curriculum Focus</h2>
    <p>HDCC 105, Introduction to Design Cultures & Creativity, serves as the foundational course for students entering the Design Cultures & Creativity (DCC) Living Learning Program. This course acts as a launchpad into the DCC journey, focusing on a pivotal contemporary phenomenon: generative artificial intelligence. Delving into software such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway, or Beautiful. AI, the curriculum immerses students in the nuanced intersections of design, culture, creativity, and AI. Exploring the complexities of generative AI, discussions center on its reliance on human creativity, the implications for various creative fields, the burgeoning field of computational creativity, and the potential for synthesizing human and computational creativities. Emphasizing the porous boundaries between art, humanities, and technology, the course encourages creative dialogue across disciplines, inviting diverse perspectives to enrich the exploration of generative AI and creativity.
