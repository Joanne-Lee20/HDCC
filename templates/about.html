    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>In 2023, the genesis of this website unfolded through a collaborative effort involving a cohort of forward-thinking UMD students and members of the esteemed <a target="_blank" href="https://dcc.umd.edu/">Design Cultures and Creativity (DCC)</a> Honors College/Living Learning program. United by a shared vision, they embarked on the creation of a public archive, an innovative venture stemming from the HDCC 105 course's curriculum. At its core, HDCC 105, the Introduction to Design Cultures & Creativity, serves as the inaugural step for students venturing into the realm of DCC. It marks the initiation of their journey towards embodying the DCC ethos of "Critical Thinkers and Makers Changing Society Through Digital Technology." Our website's principal objective is to showcase the diverse creative projects that emerged during our semester-long exploration of artificial intelligence. By sharing these endeavors, we aspire to offer visitors, including yourself, a glimpse into our unique strengths and the enriching experiences that defined our academic odyssey. We invite you to immerse yourself in these creations, hopeful that they may impart insights and joy akin to the fulfillment we derived throughout the semester.</p>

    <h2>Curriculum Focus</h2>
    <p>HDCC 105, Introduction to Design Cultures & Creativity, serves as the foundational course for students entering the Design Cultures & Creativity (DCC) Living Learning Program. This course acts as a launchpad into the DCC journey, focusing on a pivotal contemporary phenomenon: generative artificial intelligence. Delving into software such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway, or Beautiful. AI, the curriculum immerses students in the nuanced intersections of design, culture, creativity, and AI. Exploring the complexities of generative AI, discussions center on its reliance on human creativity, the implications for various creative fields, the burgeoning field of computational creativity, and the potential for synthesizing human and computational creativities. Emphasizing the porous boundaries between art, humanities, and technology, the course encourages creative dialogue across disciplines, inviting diverse perspectives to enrich the exploration of generative AI and creativity.

    <h2>Class Assignments</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Practicum:</strong> During the initial 8 weeks of the semester, students participated in a "design practicum." The emphasis during these sessions was on acquiring practical experience with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, with a focus on a different tool each week. These interactive skill-building classes featured in-class design challenges, providing students with an opportunity to earn activity points.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Groups:</strong> Teams of 6-8 students conducted thorough research on a generative AI-related topic, crafted a 5-page report, and delivered a 15-20 minute presentation in class. The Research Groups aimed to achieve three objectives: 1) enhance our understanding of a crucial aspect of generative AI, 2) better prepare us for interviews with UMD experts, and 3) initiate content creation for the Creative Workshop. The overarching goal was to identify top-notch resources on these subjects and compile a rich repository of facts, perspectives, and arguments concerning generative AI. An integral part of the research output includes contributions to the collaboratively authored Glossary of Generative AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Teams consisting of 6-8 students conducted interviews with experts from the University of Maryland for a podcast series on generative AI. Prior to the interviews, students thoroughly researched the background scholarship of the interviewees, formulated a set of pertinent questions, and subsequently conducted interviews. The recorded interviews underwent editing and were then published as part of the Creative Workshop.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Workshops:</strong> Over a six-week period in the middle of the semester, the classroom transformed into a Creative Workshop with the overarching goal of exploring the possibilities of generative AI tools, addressing the question, "What—and how much—can we create with generative AI tools?" Following the podcast interviews, students dedicated themselves to refining and enhancing the content. Embracing a critically experimental ethos, students harnessed generative AI tools to produce texts, images, music, and video that contributed to both campus and public discourse on generative AI. Small groups formulated proposals outlining work plans for specific projects, and students engaged in two substantial projects, loosely organized in "waves." The Creative Workshop's assessment was facilitated through a public work log, where students provided a daily account of their work and self-evaluated on a scale of 5 points through a designated form.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Group Posts:</strong> Throughout the six-week duration of the Creative Workshop, students divided into Reading Groups, each centering on a specific book instead of the typical weekly readings. Students had the flexibility to choose from 10 available Reading Groups, engaging in self-paced reading with two in-class meetings dedicated to discussing the chosen book. To facilitate discussion, each student authored two 500-word discussion board posts reflecting on the book ahead of each scheduled Reading Group meeting.</li>
      </ul>
